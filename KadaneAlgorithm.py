"""Output
The output of the above code will be as given below:

Maximum Sub Array Sum Is 6

Time Complexity
The time complexity of kadaneâ€™s algorithm for an array containing n integer element is O(n) as only one for loop is to be executed throughout the program. Similarly, the auxiliary space complexity of the algorithm is O(1).
