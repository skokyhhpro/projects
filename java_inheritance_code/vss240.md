# Terms used in Inheritance
- Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.
Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.
Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.
# The syntax of Java Inheritance
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

# In the terminology of Java, a class which is inherited is called a parent or superclass, and the new class is called child or subclass.
Java Inheritance Example
# Inheritance in Java
- As displayed in the above figure, Programmer is the subclass and Employee is the superclass. The relationship between the two classes is Programmer IS-A Employee. It means that Programmer is a type of Employee.
class Employee{  
 float salary=40000;  
}  
class Programmer extends Employee{  
 int bonus=10000;  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   Programmer p=new Programmer();  
   System.out.println("Programmer salary is:"+p.salary);  
   System.out.println("Bonus of Programmer is:"+p.bonus);
